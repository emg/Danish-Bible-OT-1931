# Danish Bible Old Testament 1931

## What is this?

This is the Old Testament in Danish, authorized by the Danish King in
1931, and published by the Danish Bible Society in the same year.  The
old, pre-1948 orthography has been retained.

## License?

the 1931 Danish Old Testament is in the Public Domain.  Feel free to
inquire.


##  Provenance?

Somewhere in the 1980'ies, a Danish couple scanned and OCR'ed a 1933
copy of the Danish Old Testament from 1931.  Søren Horn, one of the
Danish Internet pioneers, placed it online.  The text then found its
way to Project Runeberg at Linköping University in Sweden, from whence
Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen got it in 2005 and spent a lot of time
cleaning it up.  Ulrik then OSIS-ified it, and put it on Github in
2015.


## Whodunnit?

- A Danish couple did the initial scanning and OCR.
- Søren Horn placed it on the Internet
- Project Runeberg did some formatting and cleanup.
- Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen did some reformatting and cleanup.
